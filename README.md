# New CMS & Legacy Apps; Don't Re-Write â€” Integrate!
_Presented by:_ [Steve Withington](http://stephenwithington.com)

## Session Description
When adding a new CMS to your website or intranet, you might think you need to rewrite your legacy applications. With Mura CMS, it's simple and fast to integrate with existing applications - we'll show you how.

### In this session:
* A short overview of Mura CMS
* Programming options for integrating with your legacy applications
* Quick-start plugins for your next application

## Repository Info
This repository contains code examples used throughout the presentation. Please feel free to submit any questions via the [Issues area](https://github.com/stevewithington/cfobjective-2014/issues).

## Folders & Files
* app1
	* An uber simple example of a `page1.cfm` to `page2.cfm` type of application

* app2
	* A slightly more structured example of an application that uses directories to segregate content (e.g., `/books/index.cfm`, `/products/index.cfm`, etc.)

* app3
	* This application uses an `Application.cfc` file

* display_objects
	* These are integration examples at a *theme* level
	* Copy the folders located under `display_objects` and paste into theme's `display_objects` directory
	* Add the following method to the THEME `eventHandler.cfc`
	```
	public any function onApplicationLoad($) {
		var handler = new display_objects.app3.app3eventHandler();
		arguments.$.getBean('pluginManager').addEventHandler(handler, $.event('SiteID'));
	}
	```
	* Reload Mura CMS
	* You can now include any of the applications into Mura CMS using the following syntax:
		`#$.dspThemeInclude('display_objects/app1/index.cfm')#`
	* If adding to a Mura content item's Body area via the HTML Editor (CKEditor), use:
		`[m]$.dspThemeInclude('display_objects/app1/index.cfm')[/m]`
